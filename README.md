## Overview

This repository contains the chaincode (smart contracts) used by the HerbTrace platform. HerbTrace is a blockchain-based solution focused on the traceability, provenance, and lifecycle management of herbal product assets as they move through the supply chain.

The chaincode implements business logic for asset registration, transfer, tracking, and verification, ensuring transparency and trust among all participants in the network.

## Key Features

- **Asset Lifecycle Management**: Register, update, and track herbal product batches and assets.
- **Traceability**: Immutable tracking of assets as they move through the supply chain.
- **Ownership & Transfer**: Enable secure asset transfers between organizations/participants.
- **Event Logging**: Record and audit important events related to asset state changes.
- **Compliance and Verification**: Enforce business rules and regulatory compliance within the smart contract logic.

## Architecture

- **Platform**: Hyperledger Fabric (or similar enterprise blockchain)
- **Language**: Shell (see smart contract source files for specifics)
- **Core Modules**:
  - Asset Registration and Management
  - Ownership Transfer
  - Audit & Compliance Logging

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- Hyperledger Fabric development environment (CLI tools, local network, etc.)
- Docker (for running Fabric nodes)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/herbtrace/chaincode.git
   cd chaincode
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up and start your Hyperledger Fabric test network.

### Deployment

1. Package the chaincode:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/package.sh
   ```

2. Install and approve chaincode on peers:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy.sh
   ```

3. Instantiate the chaincode:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/instantiate.sh
   ```


## Usage

- Invoke chaincode functions using Fabric CLI, SDK, or REST API gateway (if available).
- Example: Register a new asset
  ```bash
  peer chaincode invoke -C <channel> -n <chaincode_name> -c '{"function":"RegisterAsset","Args":["assetId","data"]}'
  ```

- Query an asset
  ```bash
  peer chaincode query -C <channel> -n <chaincode_name> -c '{"function":"QueryAsset","Args":["assetId"]}'
  ```

## Development

- Follow best practices for writing and updating smart contracts.
- Ensure all business logic and compliance checks are implemented in the chaincode.
- Use version control and branching for new features or bug fixes.

## Testing

- Unit tests and integration tests should be run before deploying to production.
- Fabric test networks can be spun up locally for testing.
